A silver Taiping coin was spinning on the counter. The Innkeeper in a worn robe with a discolored green silk scarf on his head, stood behind the counter. He propped his chin on his right hand as he stared at the spinning Taiping coin in a daze. A waiter sat on a long bench against the wall and nodded off, his head bobbing up and down like a chicken slowly pecking at its food. Suddenly, a man hobbled into the lobby. The Innkeeper hurriedly reached out to stop the spinning Taiping coin on the countertop. He slowly removed his palm, revealing the words 'peace to the world' that were engraved on the coin. When the Innkeeper raised his head again, he had already plastered on his signature smile. The man who entered looked to be in his forties, with a weathered face and scars all over. His left sleeve was void, and he was limping on his right leg. However, this type of appearance was commonplace here. It neither frightened nor surprised anyone. That was because this was The Inn. Unlike ordinary inns, this 'inn' was a rowdy place. People from all walks of life—immortals and bumpkins alike—gathered here. Some patrons were rich and noble, dressed in lavish clothes, while others were criminals who could not see the light of day. There were also many mysterious figures around."
